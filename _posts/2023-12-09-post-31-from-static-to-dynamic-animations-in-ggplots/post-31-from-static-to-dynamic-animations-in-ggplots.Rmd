## Introduction

Animations are a power tool for data visualization and communication: They turn static images/figures into dynamic stories. If we say _a figure is worth a thousand words_, then I would argue that _an animation is worth a thousand figures_.

Creating animations in ggplot is not a daunting task: The extension package [`gganimate`](https://gganimate.com/) provides a plethora of functions to make ggplot animations and customize them. (See this [guest post](https://genchanghsu.github.io/ggGallery/posts/2021-05-26-guest-post-1-communicating-the-essence-of-your-data/) by William Ou on conveying the essence of data using `gganimate`!) But if you understand the underlying principle of animations, they are essentially an array of individual images/plots displayed in a chronological order, and we can easily make animations (for any kind of R plots) ourselves.

In this post, I'm going to show you how to make animations in ggplot by hand based on this simple principle, without the use of `gganimate` functions. I think this will make a fun coding exercise, and at the same time sharpen our programming skills. Also, a big shout-out to June Choe for his [neat post](https://yjunechoe.github.io/posts/2020-12-13-collapse-repetitive-piping-with-reduce/), which is the ultimate inspiration for this one. Enjoy!


## Create an animation in ggplot by hand

### (1) The static plot

Let's say we have an exmaple plot below:


```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4}
library(tidyverse)

df <- data.frame(xmin = 0, xmax = 0, 
                  ymin = -10, ymax = 10)

ggplot(df) +
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = xmin - 10, xmax = xmax + 10, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax), fill = "yellow") + 
    geom_rect(aes(xmin = xmin - 9, xmax = xmax + 9, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax), fill = "red") + 
    geom_rect(aes(xmin = xmin - 8, xmax = xmax + 8, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax), fill = "green") + 
    geom_rect(aes(xmin = xmin - 7, xmax = xmax + 7, ymin = ymin, ymax = ymax), fill = "blue") + 
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-12, 12)) + 
  theme_void()



```

### (2) Cut the repetitive code


### (3) Sequence of plots


### (4) Make it alive





## Summary


The bottom line is: produce a sequence of plots and stack them together in the desired order.
