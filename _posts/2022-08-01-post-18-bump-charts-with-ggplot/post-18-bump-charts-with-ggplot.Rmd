## Introduction

Bump charts are a special type of line charts that visualize the rankings of multiple objects over time. These charts are especially useful for comparing and highlighting trends. Honestly, I haven't really heard of this kind of charts before until recently I came across a [Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/rappa753/status/1548335653909250048/photo/1) about creating bump charts using ggplot. I then took a deeper dive into it and felt that this would certainly make an interesting topic to blog about. Also, I believe the charts will come in handy some day in the future, both for myself and for the reader like you!

So without further ado, let's jump right in!

## Prepare the data

As mentioned earlier, bump charts are useful for visualizing rankings of items over time. Instead of using a built-in R dataset, this time I'll prepare my own one, which focuses on the rankings of five ecological journals (<span style="color:#0E96D4">*Journal of Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#7581BD">*Journal of Animal Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#48A749">*Journal of Applied Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#E38D26">*Functional Ecology*</span>, and <span style="color:#DE2127">*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*</span>) from the [British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/journals/). Specifically, I would like to see how the rankings of these five journals, in terms of their impact factors, change over the past decade.   

To get the data, I visited [Journal Citation Reports](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/journal-citation-reports/) website and downloaded their impact factor records. 

Let's read in the datasets and do some data wrangling:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)  # for the function "row_to_names()"

# Create a list of url paths
BES_journals <- c("J_ECOL", "J_ANIM_ECOL", "J_APPL_ECOL", "FUNCT_ECOL", "METHODS_ECOL_EVOL")
dataset_urls <- str_glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_journals_data/{BES_journals}.csv")

# Loop through the url paths
BES_journals_data <- map(dataset_urls, function(x){
  read_csv(x) %>% 
    row_to_names(row_number = 5) %>%  # set the fifth row as column names
    slice_head(n = nrow(.)-4)  # remove the last four rows
  }) %>%
  `names<-`(BES_journals) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "Journal") %>%  # convert the list to a dataframe
  select(Journal, Year, IF = `Journal impact factor`) %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>%  # retain data starting from 2011
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  mutate(IF = as.numeric(IF),
         Ranking = row_number(desc(IF))) %>%  # add the journal rankings by year
  arrange(Year, Journal)

library(DT)  # for the function "datatable()"
datatable(BES_journals_data, options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

## Basic bump chart

Now we have our data at hand, it's time for the chart!

Creating a basic bump chart is as simple as making a scatterplot (or dotplot) of time vs. rankings and "connecting the dots" with lines, which can be done with `geom_point()` and `geom_line()`. Next, we can use `scale_y_reverse()` to flip the y-axis so that the highest-ranking item stays on the top of the plot. 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# The basic bump chart
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  scale_y_reverse() +  # the highest-ranking journal is on the top
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) +  # use the customized color palette
  theme_classic()
```

Seems that <span style="color:#DE2127">*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*</span> has been the leading journal of the five in recent years!

This figure looks fine, but we can make it shine. Let's spice it up!

There are a few things we can do to modify the chart:

<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px"> (1) Add a title, a subtitle, and a caption</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (2) Remove the legend and annotate the items directly in the plot panel</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (3) Change the background color</span>

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# install.packages("ggtext")  # install the package if you haven't
library(ggtext)  # for the function "element_markdown()"

# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# The journal labels on the left
Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# The fancy bump chart
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 11.5, y = 1:5), aes(x = x, y = y, label = y)) +
  scale_y_reverse(labels = Journal_label) +  # add the journal labels
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) + 
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",  # add the BES logo
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = 0, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -10, b = 10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 3, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

```
<div style="height: 1.2em;"></div>

Here I used the function `element_markdown()` in the package [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) to embed a logo in the plot title via the HTML `<img>` tag and to label the journals via the HTML `<span>` tag. The package has many nice features for text manipulations in ggplots using HTML and CSS syntax. I won't go into the details here, but do check out my previous [post](https://genchanghsu.github.io/ggGallery/posts/2021-07-10-post-5-awesome-text-display-with-ggtext/) on this topic if interested!

## A modified bump chart with smooth curves

Instead of connecting the dots with straight line segments like what we did in the above figure, we can use smooth curves. This is actually super easy: just replace `geom_line()` with `geom_bump()`! 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# install.packages("ggbump")  # install the package if you haven't
library(ggbump)
library(ggtext)

col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# The modified bump chart using "geom_bump()"
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_bump(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 11.5, y = 1:5), aes(x = x, y = y, label = y)) +
  scale_y_reverse(labels = Journal_label) +
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) +
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = 0, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -10, b = 10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 3, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

```

Looks pretty cool (a bit like subway maps)!

## Advanced topic - Ribbon bump chart

For the purpose of science communication, the bump charts we've created above are pretty much enough. But as a ggplot geek, it's always fun to challenge myself a bit and go a step further to try out something cool. This is the motivation for this advanced topic! Also, a shout-out to the author of the [Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/rappa753/status/1548335653909250048/photo/1) I mentioned at the beginning of the post. The idea was largely inspired by the chart he made and much of the code below is modified from his GitHub [repository](https://github.com/AlbertRapp/PublicTidyTuesday/blob/main/2022_w28_euroflights/2022_w28_euroflights.qmd).

Creating a ribbon bump chart is not an easy task and requires some data manipulations. I'll break down the process into five steps and try my best to explain what I'm doing in each step. I think this would make it easier to understand the underlying principles and hopefully you'll be able to build your own chart in the future!

So the five steps are:
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 10px"> (1) Compute the cumulative sums of journals' impact factors each year</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (2) Create a stacked bar plot of journals' impact factors each year</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (3) Determine the upper and lower curves that connect the bars of each journal</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (4) Add ribbons to the stacked bar plot</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (5) Polish the appearance of the chart</span>

Let's kick off the journey and see where we end!

### Step 1. Compute the cumulative sums of journals' impact factors each year

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# Compute the cumulative sums of the journals' IF 
BES_journals_data_barplot <- BES_journals_data %>% 
  arrange(Year, desc(Ranking)) %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  mutate(y_start = c(0, cumsum(IF)[-length(IF)]),
         y_end = cumsum(IF)) %>% 
  ungroup()

datatable(BES_journals_data_barplot, options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

### Step 2. Create a stacked bar plot of journals' impact factors each year

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# Create a stacked barplot of the journals' IF each year
ribbon_bumpchart <- ggplot(BES_journals_data_barplot) + 
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.numeric(Year) - 0.05, xmax = as.numeric(Year) + 0.05,
                ymin = y_start, ymax = y_end, fill = Journal), color = "white") +   scale_fill_manual(values = col_pal) +
  theme_classic()

ribbon_bumpchart
```


### Step 3. Determine the upper and lower curves that connect the bars of each journal

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
library(ggbump)  # for the function "sigmoid()"

# Compute the upper and lower boundaries of the ribbons connecting the bars
BES_journals_data_ribbon <- BES_journals_data_barplot %>% 
  split(., .$Journal) %>% 
  map(., function(data){
    upper_curve <- data %>% 
      select(Journal, Year, y_end) %>% 
      mutate(x_from = as.numeric(Year) + 0.05,
             x_to = as.numeric(Year) + 1 - 0.05,
             y_from = y_end - 0.1,
             y_to = c(y_end[-1], NA) - 0.1) %>% 
      filter(Year != "2021") %>% 
      rowwise() %>% 
      mutate(curve = list(sigmoid(x_from, x_to, y_from, y_to, n = 100, smooth = 8))) %>% 
      unnest() %>% 
      select(Journal, x, y_upper = y)
        
    lower_curve <- data %>%
      select(Journal, Year, y_start) %>% 
      mutate(x_from = as.numeric(Year) + 0.05,
             x_to = as.numeric(Year) + 1 - 0.05,
             y_from = y_start + 0.1,
             y_to = c(y_start[-1], NA) + 0.1) %>% 
      filter(Year != "2021") %>% 
      rowwise() %>% 
      mutate(curve = list(sigmoid(x_from, x_to, y_from, y_to, n = 100, smooth = 8))) %>% 
      unnest() %>% 
      select(Journal, x, y_lower = y)
    
    curve <- left_join(upper_curve, lower_curve[, -1], by = "x")
  }) %>% bind_rows()

datatable(BES_journals_data_ribbon, options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

### Step 4. Add ribbons to the stacked bar plot

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# Add the ribbons to the bar plot 
ribbon_bumpchart <- ribbon_bumpchart + 
  geom_ribbon(data = BES_journals_data_ribbon, 
              aes(x = x, ymin = y_lower, ymax = y_upper, fill = Journal), alpha = 0.75)

# Move the bars to the top  
library(gginnards)

ribbon_bumpchart <- move_layers(ribbon_bumpchart, "GeomRect", position = "top")
ribbon_bumpchart

```

### Step 5. Polish the appearance of the chart

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# Journal labels
Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# Journal label positions
Journal_label_position <- filter(BES_journals_data_barplot, Year == 2011)$y_end - filter(BES_journals_data_barplot, Year == 2011)$IF/2

# Modify the appearance of the chart
ribbon_bumpchart +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2011:2021)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = Journal_label_position, labels = rev(Journal_label)) +
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = -5, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -5, b = -10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 1, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

```
