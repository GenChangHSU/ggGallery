## Introduction

Bump charts are a special type of line charts that visualize the rankings of multiple objects over time. These charts are especially useful for comparing and highlighting trends. Honestly, I haven't really heard of this kind of charts before until recently I came across a [Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/rappa753/status/1548335653909250048/photo/1) about creating bump charts using ggplot. I then took a deeper dive into it and felt that this would certainly make an interesting topic to blog about. Also, I believe the charts will come in handy some day in the future, both for myself and for the reader like you!

So without further ado, let's jump right in!

## Prepare the data

As mentioned earlier, bump charts are useful for visualizing rankings of items over time. Instead of using a built-in R dataset, this time I'll prepare my own one, which focuses on the rankings of five ecological journals (<span style="color:#0E96D4">*Journal of Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#7581BD">*Journal of Animal Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#48A749">*Journal of Applied Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#E38D26">*Functional Ecology*</span>, and <span style="color:#DE2127">*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*</span>) from the [British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/journals/). Specifically, I would like to see how the rankings of these five journals, in terms of their impact factors, change over the past decade.   

To get the data, I visited [Journal Citation Reports](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/journal-citation-reports/) website and downloaded their impact factor records. 

Let's read in the datasets and do some data wrangling:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)  # for the function "row_to_names()"

# Create a list of url paths
BES_journals <- c("J_ECOL", "J_ANIM_ECOL", "J_APPL_ECOL", "FUNCT_ECOL", "METHODS_ECOL_EVOL")
dataset_urls <- str_glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_journals_data/{BES_journals}.csv")

# Loop through the url paths
BES_journals_data <- map(dataset_urls, function(x){
  read_csv(x) %>% 
    row_to_names(row_number = 5) %>%  # set the fifth row as column names
    slice_head(n = nrow(.)-4)  # remove the last four rows
  }) %>%
  `names<-`(BES_journals) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "Journal") %>%  # convert the list to a dataframe
  select(Journal, Year, IF = `Journal impact factor`) %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>%  # retain data starting from 2011
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  mutate(IF = as.numeric(IF),
         Ranking = row_number(desc(IF))) %>%  # add the journal rankings by year
  arrange(Year, Journal)
  
head(BES_journals_data, n = 10)
```
<br>

## Basic bump chart

Now we have our data at hand, it's time for the chart!

Creating a basic bump chart is as simple as making a scatterplot (or dotplot) of time vs. rankings and "connecting the dots" with lines, which can be done with `geom_point()` and `geom_line()`. Next, we can use `scale_y_reverse()` to flip the y-axis so that the highest-ranking item stays on the top of the plot. 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# The basic bump chart
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  scale_y_reverse() +  # the highest-ranking journal is on the top
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) +  # use the customized color palette
  theme_classic()
```

Seems that <span style="color:#DE2127">*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*</span> has been the leading journal of the five in recent years!

This figure looks fine, but we can make it shine. Let's spice it up!

There are a few things we can do to modify the chart:

<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px"> (1) Add a title, a subtitle, and a caption</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (2) Remove the legend and annotate the items directly in the plot panel</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (3) Change the background color</span>

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# install.packages("ggtext")  # install the package if you haven't
library(ggtext)  # for the function "element_markdown()"

# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# The journal labels on the left
Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# The fancy bump chart
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 11.5, y = 1:5), aes(x = x, y = y, label = y)) +
  scale_y_reverse(labels = Journal_label) +  # add the journal labels
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) + 
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",  # add the BES logo
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = 0, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -10, b = 10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 3, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

```
<br>

Here I used the function `element_markdown()` in the package [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) to embed a logo in the plot title via the HTML `<img>` tag and to label the journals via the HTML `<span>` tag. The package has many nice features for text manipulations in ggplots using HTML and CSS syntax. I won't go into the details here, but do check out my previous [post](https://genchanghsu.github.io/ggGallery/posts/2021-07-10-post-5-awesome-text-display-with-ggtext/) on this topic if interested!

## A modified bump chart with smooth curves

Instead of connecting the dots with straight line segments like what we did in the above figure, we can use smooth curves. This is actually super easy: just replace `geom_line()` with `geom_bump()`! 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# install.packages("ggbump")  # install the package if you haven't
library(ggbump)
library(ggtext)

col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# The modified bump chart using "geom_bump()"
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_bump(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 11.5, y = 1:5), aes(x = x, y = y, label = y)) +
  scale_y_reverse(labels = Journal_label) +
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) +
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = 0, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -10, b = 10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 3, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

```

<div style="height: 1.2em;"></div>

Looks pretty cool (a bit like subway maps)!
