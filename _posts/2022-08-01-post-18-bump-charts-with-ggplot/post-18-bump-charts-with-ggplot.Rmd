## Introduction

Bump charts are a special type of line charts that visualize the rankings of multiple objects over time. These charts are especially useful for comparing and highlighting trends. Honestly, I haven't really heard of this kind of charts before until recently I came across a [Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/rappa753/status/1548335653909250048/photo/1) about creating bump charts using ggplot. I then took a deeper dive into it and felt that this would certainly make an interesting blog topic. Also, I believe the charts will come in handy someday in the future, both for myself and for the readers like you!

So without further ado, let's jump right in!

## Prepare the data

As mentioned earlier, bump charts are useful for visualizing rankings of items over time. Instead of using a built-in R dataset, this time I'll prepare my own one, which focuses on the rankings of five ecological journals (<span style="color:#0E96D4">*Journal of Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#7581BD">*Journal of Animal Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#48A749">*Journal of Applied Ecology*</span>, <span style="color:#E38D26">*Functional Ecology*</span>, and <span style="color:#DE2127">*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*</span>) from the [British Ecological Society](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/publications/journals/). Specifically, I would like to see how the rankings of these five journals, in terms of their impact factors (IFs), change over the past decade.   

To get the data, I visited [Journal Citation Reports](https://clarivate.com/webofsciencegroup/solutions/journal-citation-reports/) website and downloaded the journals' IF records. 

Let's read in the datasets and do some data wrangling:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)  # for the function "row_to_names()"

# Create a list of url paths
BES_journals <- c("J_ECOL", "J_ANIM_ECOL", "J_APPL_ECOL", "FUNCT_ECOL", "METHODS_ECOL_EVOL")
dataset_urls <- str_glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_journals_data/{BES_journals}.csv")

# Loop through the url paths
BES_journals_data <- map(dataset_urls, function(x){
  read_csv(x) %>% 
    row_to_names(row_number = 5) %>%  # set the fifth row as column names
    slice_head(n = nrow(.)-4)  # remove the last four rows
  }) %>%
  `names<-`(BES_journals) %>%
  bind_rows(.id = "Journal") %>%  # convert the list to a dataframe
  select(Journal, Year, IF = `Journal impact factor`) %>% 
  filter(Year >= 2011) %>%  # retain data starting from 2011
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  mutate(IF = as.numeric(IF),
         Ranking = row_number(desc(IF))) %>%  # add the journal rankings by year
  arrange(Year, Journal)

library(DT)  # for the function "datatable()"
datatable(BES_journals_data, options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

## Basic bump chart

Now we have our data on hand, it's time for the chart!

Creating a basic bump chart is as simple as making a scatterplot (or dotplot) of time vs. rankings and "connecting the dots" with lines, which can be done with `geom_line()` and `geom_point()`. Also, we can use `scale_y_reverse()` to flip the y-axis so that the highest-ranking item stays on the top of the plot. 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# The basic bump chart
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  scale_y_reverse() +  # the highest-ranking journal is on the top
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) +  # use the customized color palette
  theme_classic()
```

Seems that <span style="color:#DE2127">*Methods in Ecology and Evolution*</span> has been the leading journal of the five in recent years!

This figure looks fine, but we can make it shine. Let's spice it up!

There are a few things we can do to modify the chart:

<span style="display: block; margin-top: 0px; margin-left: 10px"> (1) Add a title, a subtitle, and a caption</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (2) Remove the legend and annotate the items directly in the plot panel</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (3) Change the background color</span>

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# install.packages("ggtext")  # install the package if you haven't
library(ggtext)  # for the function "element_markdown()"

# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# The journal labels on the left
Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# The fancy bump chart
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 11.5, y = 1:5), aes(x = x, y = y, label = y)) +
  scale_y_reverse(labels = Journal_label) +  # add the journal labels
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) + 
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",  # add the BES logo
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = 0, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -10, b = 10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 3, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

```
<div style="height: 1.2em;"></div>

Here I used the function `element_markdown()` from the package [`ggtext`](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) to embed a logo in the plot title via the HTML `<img>` tag and to label the journals via the HTML `<span>` tag. The package has many nice features for text manipulations in ggplots using HTML and CSS syntax. I won't go into the details here, but do check out my previous [post](https://genchanghsu.github.io/ggGallery/posts/2021-07-10-post-5-awesome-text-display-with-ggtext/) on this topic if interested!

## A modified bump chart with smooth curves

Instead of connecting the dots with straight line segments like what we did in the above figure, we can use smooth curves. This is actually super easy: just replace `geom_line()` with `geom_bump()`! 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# install.packages("ggbump")  # install the package if you haven't
library(ggbump)
library(ggtext)

col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# The modified bump chart using "geom_bump()"
ggplot(BES_journals_data) + 
  geom_bump(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal, group = Journal), size = 2) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Year, y = Ranking, color = Journal), shape = 21, fill = "white", size = 4, stroke = 2) +
  geom_text(data = data.frame(x = 11.5, y = 1:5), aes(x = x, y = y, label = y)) +
  scale_y_reverse(labels = Journal_label) +
  scale_color_manual(values = col_pal) +
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = 0, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -10, b = 10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 3, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

```

<div style="height: 1.2em;"></div>

Looks pretty cool (a bit like subway maps)!

## Advanced topic - Ribbon bump chart

For the purpose of science communication, the bump charts we've created above are pretty much enough. But as a ggplot geek, it's always fun to challenge myself a bit and go a step further to try out something cool. This is the motive for this advanced topic! Also, a shout-out to the author of the [Tweet](https://mobile.twitter.com/rappa753/status/1548335653909250048/photo/1) I mentioned at the beginning of the post. The idea was largely inspired by the chart he made and much of the code below is modified from his GitHub [repository](https://github.com/AlbertRapp/PublicTidyTuesday/blob/main/2022_w28_euroflights/2022_w28_euroflights.qmd).

Creating a ribbon bump chart is not an easy task and requires some data manipulations. I'll break down the process into four steps and explain what I'm doing in each step. I think this would make it easier to understand the underlying principles and hopefully you'll be able to build your own chart in the future.

So the four steps are:
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 3px; margin-left: 10px"> (1) Create a stacked barplot of journals' impact factors over year</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (2) Compute the curves that connect the upper/lower ends of the bars for each journal</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (3) Add ribbons to the stacked barplot</span>
<span style="display: block; margin-top: 5px; margin-left: 10px"> (4) Polish the appearance of the chart</span>

Let's kick off our plotting journey. Enjoy!

### Step 1. Create a stacked barplot of journals' impact factors over year

To create a stacked barplot of the journals' IFs, we need to determine the upper and lower ends of the bars. We'll do this by first arranging the journals in a descending order based on their rankings each year (so the lowest-ranking journal will be on the top of the dataframe) and then calculating the cumulative sums of the journals' IFs, which will be the upper ends of the bars. For the lower ends, they'll be the cumulative sums minus the journals' own IFs.  

It's noteworthy that here we won't use the conventional geom layer `geom_bar()` to create the barplot, but `geom_rect()` instead. The main reason for using `geom_rect()` rather than `geom_bar()` is that `geom_rect()` allows us to order the bars differently for each year, whereas `geom_bar()` will place the bars in the same order across years. Since the journal rankings varied across years, we should use the former.

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# Calculate the cumulative sums of the journals' IFs 
BES_journals_data_bars <- BES_journals_data %>% 
  arrange(Year, desc(Ranking)) %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  mutate(y_upper = cumsum(IF),
         y_lower = cumsum(IF) - IF) %>% 
  ungroup()

# A color palette for the journals
col_pal <- set_names(c("#0e96d4", "#7581bd", "#48a749", "#e38d26", "#de2127"), nm = BES_journals)

# Create a stacked barplot of the journals' IFs each year
ribbon_bumpchart_bars <- ggplot(BES_journals_data_bars) + 
  geom_rect(aes(xmin = as.numeric(Year) - 0.05, xmax = as.numeric(Year) + 0.05,
                ymin = y_lower, ymax = y_upper, fill = Journal), color = "white") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = col_pal) +
  theme_classic()

ribbon_bumpchart_bars
```

### Step 2. Compute the curves that connect the upper/lower ends of the bars for each journal

Now comes the core part of the process: computing the curves that connect the upper/lower ends of the bars for each journal. These upper/lower curves form the boundaries of the ribbons that we'll be adding to the plot later. We'll split the original dataframe into individual subsets by journal and do the computation separately for each of them.  

First, for each subset, we'll create four new columns: **x_from**, **x_to**, **y_from**, and **y_to**. **x_from** is the current year plus the bar width (which is 0.05); **x_to** is the next year minus bar width; **y_from** is the upper/lower ends of the bars in the current year; **y_to** is the upper/lower ends of the bars next year. Together, these four columns serve as the x- and y-coordinates of the two points (**x_from**, **y_from**) and (**x_to**, **y_to**), between which a smooth connecting curve will be derived.

Note that in the below code chunk, the **y_to** for the year 2022 was set to `NA` because there is no next bar to go, and the row for that year was later removed. Also, I subtracted 0.1 from the upper end and added 0.1 to the lower end to create a margin between ribbons so that the ribbons will not go shoulder to shoulder when we plot them later.

Next, we'll use the function `sigmoid()` from the package `ggbump` to compute a smooth sigmoid curve between the two points (**x_from**, **y_from**) and (**x_to**, **y_to**). The smoothness of the curve can be adjusted via the arguments `n` and `smooth` (play around with different values to see how the ribbons change!).

Finally, we'll merge the results (the x- and y-coordinates of the points forming the smooth curves) of each subset into a single dataframe, which contains all the information we need for plotting the ribbons.

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
library(ggbump)  # for the function "sigmoid()"

# Compute the upper/lower curves connecting the bars
BES_journals_data_ribbons <- BES_journals_data_bars %>% 
  split(., .$Journal) %>% 
  map(., function(data){
    
    # the upper curve
    upper_curve <- data %>% 
      select(Journal, Year, y_upper) %>% 
      mutate(x_from = as.numeric(Year) + 0.05,
             x_to = as.numeric(Year) + 1 - 0.05,
             y_from = y_upper - 0.1,  # 0.1 sets the margin between adjacent ribbons
             y_to = c(y_upper[-1], NA) - 0.1) %>% 
      filter(Year != "2021") %>% 
      rowwise() %>% 
      mutate(curve = list(sigmoid(x_from, x_to, y_from, y_to, n = 100, smooth = 8))) %>% 
      unnest() %>% 
      select(Journal, x, y_upper = y)
    
    # the lower curve    
    lower_curve <- data %>%
      select(Journal, Year, y_lower) %>% 
      mutate(x_from = as.numeric(Year) + 0.05,
             x_to = as.numeric(Year) + 1 - 0.05,
             y_from = y_lower + 0.1,
             y_to = c(y_lower[-1], NA) + 0.1) %>% 
      filter(Year != "2021") %>% 
      rowwise() %>% 
      mutate(curve = list(sigmoid(x_from, x_to, y_from, y_to, n = 100, smooth = 8))) %>% 
      unnest() %>% 
      select(Journal, x, y_lower = y)
    
    # put the two dataframes together
    curve <- left_join(upper_curve, lower_curve[, -1], by = "x")
  }) %>% bind_rows()  # merge the results

datatable(BES_journals_data_ribbons, options = list(pageLength = 5))
```

### Step 3. Add ribbons to the stacked barplot

Ready to draw the ribbons! We'll use `geom_ribbon()` and specify the upper (`ymax = `) and lower (`y_min = `) boundary. The ribbons were adjusted to be slightly transparent so that when two ribbons cross each other, the one beneath can still be seen.

We'll also use the function `move_layers()` from the package `gginnards` to pull the bars (which were drawn on the `geom_rect()` layer) to the top. Otherwise, the bars will be completely covered by the ribbons!

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# Add the ribbons to the barplot 
ribbon_bumpchart <- ribbon_bumpchart_bars + 
  geom_ribbon(data = BES_journals_data_ribbons, 
              aes(x = x, ymax = y_upper, ymin = y_lower, fill = Journal), alpha = 0.75)

# Move the bars to the top  
library(gginnards)

ribbon_bumpchart <- move_layers(ribbon_bumpchart, "GeomRect", position = "top")
ribbon_bumpchart

```

### Step 4. Polish the appearance of the chart

Here we are at our final step: polishing the appearance of the chart! Again, we'll add a logo title, a subtitle, and a caption to it. We'll also label the years along the x-axis as well as the journal names on the left of the ribbons.  

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 5, out.width = "85%"}
# Journal labels
Journal_label <- c("<span style = 'color: #de2127'>Methods in<br>Ecology and Evolution</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #48a749'>Journal of<br>Applied Ecology",
                   "<span style = 'color: #0e96d4'>Journal of Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #7581bd'>Journal of<br>Animal Ecology</span>",
                   "<span style = 'color: #e38d26'>Functional Ecology</span>")

# Journal label positions
Journal_label_position <- filter(BES_journals_data_bars, Year == 2011)$y_upper - filter(BES_journals_data_bars, Year == 2011)$IF/2

# Modify the appearance of the chart
ribbon_bumpchart <- ribbon_bumpchart +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2011:2021)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = Journal_label_position, labels = rev(Journal_label)) +
  labs(title = "<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GenChangHSU/ggGallery/master/_posts/2022-08-01-post-18-bump-charts-with-ggplot/BES_logo_tp.png' width = '100'/>",
       subtitle = "Journal rankings based on their impact factors each year",
       caption = "Data source: Journal Citation Reports") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        plot.margin = margin(5, 5, 5, 5),
        plot.background = element_rect(fill = "#b6e3d4", color = NA),
        plot.title = element_markdown(margin = margin(b = -5, unit = "mm"), hjust = -0.1),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(margin = margin(t = -5, b = -10, unit = "mm"), hjust = 0.35, face = "bold", size = 13),
        plot.caption = element_text(margin = margin(t = 5, unit = "mm"), face = "italic", color = "grey60"),
        axis.text.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 1, unit = "mm"), size = 10),
        axis.text.y = element_markdown(margin = margin(r = -5, unit = "mm"), color = NULL, size = 11))

ribbon_bumpchart
```

<div style="height: 1.2em;"></div>

After a long trek through the code, we've now reached the destination of our plotting journey. Hooray! 

## Summary

To recap what we did in this post, we first created a basic bump charts from scratch using `geom_line()` and `geom_point()`. Next, we used `geom_bump()` to create a modified bump chart with smooth curves connecting the points. Lastly, we went on an adventure and created a ribbon bump chart step by step, including some data manipulations to get the data we need for plotting. After doing this post, I found bump charts quite handy and I think I should use them more often for communication. I believe you think so too!

Hope you learn something useful from this post and don't forget to leave your comments and suggestions below if you have any!
