## Introduction

Feel so glad (and relieved) to blog again after three months of rest! This post was actually inspired by a recent project I am working on: I wanted to make a ggplot comparing the feeding response of control vs. treatment for each larval parent family on two plant types, and I would like to draw a line connecting the control-treatment pair for each family for each plant type. I thought it was a walk in the park, but when I started making the plot, it turned out to be more complicated than I imagined. Thankfully, after a bit of researching and experimenting, I figured it out and I felt it would be helpful to write something about it. So in this post, I'll show you the tips for connecting paired points in ggplots. Let's do it!


## Case 1. A single group

We will use the built-in [CO2](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/datasets/versions/3.6.2/topics/CO2) dataset, which contains data from an experiment looking at how chilling affected the CO~2~ uptake rates of the grass species *Echinochloa crus-galli*. 

Let's start with the simplest case where we compare the CO~2~ uptake rates of the nonchilled vs. chilled plant individual #1 at different ambient CO~2~ concentrations. We'll draw a line between each nonchilled-chilled pair to show the treatment effect.

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 4, out.height = "70%", out.width = "60%"}
library(tidyverse)

### Select plant individual #1
CO2_plant_1 <- filter(CO2, Plant %in% c("Qn1", "Qc1")) 
  
### Plot  
ggplot(CO2_plant_1) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatment, y = uptake, shape = Treatment, color = factor(conc))) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatment, y = uptake, color = factor(conc), group = factor(conc))) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Ambient [CO2]") + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 13)

```

Looks like chilling reduces CO~2~ uptake rates of plant individual #1 under all ambient CO~2~ concentrations.

## Case 2. Two or more groups

Now, what if we're interested in other plant individuals? Would the patterns be similar? Let's make another plot and see.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, out.width = "80%"}
### Select plant individual #1 to #3
CO2_plant_1_to_3 <- filter(CO2, Plant %in% c("Qn1", "Qc1", "Qn2", "Qc2", "Qn3", "Qc3")) %>% 
  mutate(Plant_id = str_remove(Plant, "(n|c)")) %>% 
  mutate(Plant_conc_id = str_c(Plant_id, conc, sep = "_"))  # create a unique id for the paired points
  
### Plot  
ggplot(CO2_plant_1_to_3) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Plant_id, y = uptake, group = Treatment, shape = Treatment, color = factor(conc)),
             position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Plant_id, y = uptake, group = Plant_conc_id, color = factor(conc)),
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.8)) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Ambient [CO2]") + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 13)

```

Oops it doesn't work. How can we solve this problem? Read below!

### Method 1. Use facets

The first method is to create separate panels for each plant individual using facets. This is a easy quick fix.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, out.width = "80%"}
### Plot  
ggplot(CO2_plant_1_to_3) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Treatment, y = uptake, color = factor(conc))) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Treatment, y = uptake, group = factor(conc), color = factor(conc))) + 
  facet_wrap( ~ Plant_id) +  # faceting by plant id
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Ambient [CO2]") + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 13)

```

As we can see, all three plant individuals showed similar responses to chilling.

### Method 2. Manually dodge the endpoints of the connecting lines

The second method is to manually dodge the endpoints of the connecting lines. This requires slightly more work, but is a non-facet alternative. So basically, we need to dodge the nonchilled and chilled points to the two sides of each plant individual (the x-positions of the three plants are indeed 1, 2, and 3), map the new dodged positions to the x aesthetic in `geomline()`, and specify each plant individualâ€“CO~2~ concentration combination as the grouping variable. Sounds a bit abstract?! Let's take a look at the code below to get a better idea of how it works.

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, out.width = "80%"}
### Dodge the nonchilled and chilled points
CO2_plant_1_to_3_recoded <- CO2_plant_1_to_3 %>% 
  mutate(Plant_id_x = case_when(Plant_id == "Q1" ~ 1,  # these are the x-positions of the three plant individuals
                                Plant_id == "Q2" ~ 2,
                                Plant_id == "Q3" ~ 3),
         Plant_id_x_dodged = case_when(Treatment == "nonchilled" ~ Plant_id_x - 0.25,  # dodge the "nonchilled" points to the left of each plant individual
                                       Treatment == "chilled" ~ Plant_id_x + 0.25))   # dodge the "chilled" points to the right of each plant individual

### Plot
ggplot(CO2_plant_1_to_3_recoded) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = Plant_id, y = uptake, shape = Treatment, group = Treatment, color = factor(conc)),
             position = position_dodge(width = 1)) + 
  geom_line(aes(x = Plant_id_x_dodged, y = uptake, group = Plant_conc_id, color = factor(conc))) + 
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1", name = "Ambient [CO2]") + 
  theme_classic(base_size = 13)

```
We made it!

## Summary

To recap, we looked at how to connect paired points with lines for a single group as well as for multiple groups. When there are multiple groups, we can use facets or manually dodge the endpoints of the lines. This type of paired-points plot is especially useful for visualizing the treatment effects, and I'm pretty sure you'll be creating it in the future.
