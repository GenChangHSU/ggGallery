## Background

Recently, I stumbled upon a [post](https://www.behance.net/gallery/100683383/Travelling-to-Outer-Space) by data visualization designer CÃ©dric Scherer, and I was completely blown away: I could never imagine how amazing ggplots can be (I believe you'll be in awe of it too)! Inspired by this, I hope to create my own one as well, both for fun and for learning and practicing. In fact, I think this is an excellent opportunity to bring together different data science skills: data scraping, data wrangling, and data visualization.

Now take a deep breath. The rocket is about to lift off and we are ready for our space travel!!!

## Step-by-step guide to the solar system




### Step 1. Scrape planetary data

Scrape the table

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "75%"}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)


```

### Step 2. Add url paths to the planet images

Add wiki url paths to the images

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "75%"}



```

### Step 3. Create a line chart of planets

line chart with distance to sun as x axis (reverse the axis) and size as y axis
blurry points with planet sizes as area size, color by dist to sun
add solid opaque points
color the line by distance to sun

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "75%"}



```

### Step 4. Create a polar barplot

make the plot circular
add the planet images and labels (white)
add a sun in the middle

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "75%"}



```


### Step 5. Polish the figure 

black background
add random dots as stars
add some annotations

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "75%"}



```

We're at the very end of the solar system. It's time to get back to Earth.
