## Background

Recently, I stumbled upon a [post](https://www.behance.net/gallery/100683383/Travelling-to-Outer-Space) by data visualization designer CÃ©dric Scherer, and I was completely blown away: I could never imagine how amazing ggplots can be (I believe you'll be in awe of it too)! Inspired by this, I hope to create my own one as well, both for fun and for learning and practicing. In fact, I think this is an excellent opportunity to bring together different data science skills: data scraping, data wrangling, and data visualization.

The rocket is about to lift off now. Take a deep breath and we are ready for our space journey!!!

## A leg-by-leg journey to the solar system

This is quite a long journey, and so I'll break it down into several legs so that we can fully explore the scenery along the way.

### Leg 1. Scrape the planetary data

Our first leg is to prepare the planetary data for our figure. We'll do so by scraping the information from the website and organizing it into a tidy table.

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9, out.width = "80%"}
library(tidyverse)
library(rvest)  # for scraping the website
library(janitor)  # for the function "clean_names()"

### Read the website content 
html <- read_html("https://www.encyclopedia.com/reference/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/major-planets-solar-system-table")

### Extract and organize the table
planetary_dat <- html %>% 
  html_element("table") %>%  # find the <table> element in the content
  html_table() %>%  # parse the table into a dataframe
  slice(-c(1, 2, 4)) %>%  # remove row 1, 2, and 4
  select(where(function(x){!is.na(x) %>% any()})) %>%  # remove the columns with NAs
  `colnames<-`(.[1, ]) %>%  # set the first row as the header
  .[-1, ] %>%  # remove the first row
  mutate(across(c(2, 5, 6, 7), as.numeric)) %>%  # convert these columns to numeric
  rowid_to_column(var = "row_id") %>%  # add a row id
  clean_names() %>%  # clean the column names
  mutate(volume_earth_1 = (diameter_earth_1)^3)  # volumes of the planets relative to Earth

head(planetary_dat, 5)

```

### Leg 2. Retrieve the url paths to the planet images

Our next leg is to add the urls of planet images to our planetary data and create HTML `<img>` tags for later plotting. The column `image_width` specifies the sizes of the images that will show up in the figure later.

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9, out.width = "80%"}
library(glue)

planetary_dat <- planetary_dat %>%
  mutate(image_url = c(
    "https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2015/whatsimporta.jpg",
    "https://cdn.britannica.com/86/21186-050-C48F8AA1/radar-clouds-Scientists-surface-Venus-computer-image.jpg",
    "https://cdn.britannica.com/25/160325-050-EB1C8FB7/image-instruments-Earth-satellite-NASA-Suomi-National-2012.jpg",
    "https://mars.nasa.gov/system/content_pages/main_images/256_Webp.net-resizeimage_%284%29.jpg",
    "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c1/Jupiter_New_Horizons.jpg",
    "https://cdn.britannica.com/80/145480-050-24BF0658/image-Hubble-Space-Telescope-Saturn-moons-shadow.jpg",
    "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c9/Uranus_as_seen_by_NASA%27s_Voyager_2_%28remastered%29_-_JPEG_converted.jpg",
    "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Neptune_-_Voyager_2_%2829347980845%29_flatten_crop.jpg")) %>%  # the urls of planet images
  mutate(image_width = c(11.5, 12, 13, 26.5, 27, 45, 18, 16.5)) %>%  # image sizes
  mutate(image_tag = glue("<img src='{image_url}' width = '{image_width}'/>"))  # HTML <img> tags

```

### Leg 3. Create a basic polar line-dot chart of planets

The previous two legs were mostly about data preparation, and now we are ready to roll up our sleeves and do some heavy lifting. In our third leg, we will create a polar line-dot chart for the planets, with the length of the line/curve proportional to the distance of the planet to the Sun, and the size of the point proportional to the volume of the planet.

Here I used the function `geom_point_blur()` in the package `ggblur` to add blurry points, and the functions `lighten()` and `desaturate()` in the package `colorspace` to modify the color of the points and lines. Also, I extended the lower limit of the x-axis to -1 to create some extra space at the center of the figure where we will be adding an image later, and extended the upper limit of the y-axis to 35 to prevent the longest line from sticking too close to the origin.  

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9, out.width = "80%"}
library(ggblur)  # for the function "geom_point_blur()"
library(ggforce)  # for the function "geom_link()"
library(colorspace)  # for the function "lighten()" and "desaturate()"

P_solar_system <- ggplot() + 
  geom_point_blur(data = planetary_dat, aes(x = row_id, y = distance_from_the_sun_au,
                                            color = row_id, color = after_scale(lighten(color, 0.5, space = "HLS")),
                                            size = volume_earth_1, blur_size = volume_earth_1)) +
  geom_link(data = planetary_dat, aes(x = row_id, y = 0, xend = row_id, 
                                      yend = distance_from_the_sun_au,
                                      color = row_id, color = after_scale(desaturate(color, 0.3))), 
            size = 0.75, n = 300) +
  geom_point(data = planetary_dat, aes(x = row_id, y = distance_from_the_sun_au, 
                                       color = row_id, size = volume_earth_1)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-1, 8)) +  # extend the lower limit of the x-axis
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 35)) +  # extend the upper limit of the y-axis
  scale_blur_size_continuous(range = c(5, 20)) + 
  guides(color = "none", size = "none", blur_size = "none") + 
  coord_polar(theta = "y", clip = "off")

P_solar_system

```

### Leg 4. Make the lines and points shine

Our forth leg is to change the appearance of the basic chart we just made earlier. Specifically, I change the color of the lines and points using a customized color palette created with the function `tableau_div_gradient_pal()` in the package `ggtheme`. I also added a vertical line at the origin using the function `geom_link2()` in the package `ggforce`, which allows for continuous color gradients along the line. I think this vertical line serves as an anchor for the curves so that they don't seem to be floating. Lastly, I set the background to black. 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9, out.width = "80%"}
library(ggthemes)  # for the function "tableau_div_gradient_pal()"

col_pal <- rev(tableau_div_gradient_pal(palette = "Sunset-Sunrise Diverging")(seq(0, 1, length = 8)))  # create a customized color palette
           
P_solar_system <- P_solar_system + 
  geom_link2(aes(x = 1:8, y = 0, xend = 2:9, yend = 0, color = 1:8), n = 100) +
  scale_color_gradientn(colors = col_pal) + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "black"),  # black background
        plot.margin = margin(0, 0, 0, 0))

P_solar_system

```

### Leg 5. Add the planet images

Leg five is an exciting one: adding the planet images! We'll achieve this by mapping the HTML <img> tags we created in leg two to the chart, using the function `geom_richtext()` in the package `ggtext`. By the way, `ggtext` is a super handy package for text manipulations in ggplots. Check out my [previous post](https://genchanghsu.github.io/ggGallery/posts/2021-07-10-post-5-awesome-text-display-with-ggtext/) for more details if interested!

Oh, did you notice that the lower left corner of the Saturn image covered the curve? How can we fix this? Easy-peasy: just move the image layer to the very bottom! The function `move_layers()` in the package `gginnards` will do the trick. 

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9, out.width = "80%"}
library(ggtext)

P_solar_system <- P_solar_system + 
    geom_richtext(data = planetary_dat, aes(x = row_id, y = distance_from_the_sun_au,
                                            label = image_tag),
                  color = NA, fill = NA,
                  nudge_x = c(0, 0, 0, 0, -0.3, -0.2, 0, 0),
                  nudge_y = c(2.4, 1.7, 1.3, 1, 1.4, 1.1, 0.7, 0.6)) +
    geom_richtext(aes(x = -1, y = 0, label = "<img src='https://res.cloudinary.com/dtpgi0zck/image/upload/s--fMAvJ-9u--/c_fit,h_580,w_860/v1/EducationHub/photos/sun-blasts-a-m66-flare.jpg' width='60'/>"), 
                  color = NA, fill = NA)

library(gginnards)

map_chr(P_solar_system$layers, function(x){class(x$geom)[1]})  # get the layer names
P_solar_system <- move_layers(P_solar_system, "GeomRichText", position = "bottom")  # move the layer "GeomRichText" to the bottom  
P_solar_system

```

### Leg 6. Add a title and planet labels  

Our sixth leg is to add a title and planet labels to the chart. Here I used `geom_text()` to map the planet labels to the desired positions, and again `geom_richtext()` to add a title using the HTML syntax.

I think you might wonder why I padded the planet labels. Actually, when I just added the labels and adjusted their positions to the left of the vertical line by setting `hjust = 1`, these labels were left-shifted but right-aligned (which didn't look so pleasant in my opinion). This is mainly due to the fact that the labels are of different lengths. I wanted the labels to be centered, and so I used this padding trick to make the labels extremely long and of similar lengths. In this way, I don't have to adjust the positions that much (`hjust = 0.7` would be enough to shift the labels to the left), and this will largely reduce the right-alignment problem.

After some trial and error, the labels seemed to be fairly centered. Sometimes it does take a while to experiment and fine-tune the values when you adjust the item positions (and this could even a bit irritating!). But isn't this the most fun and fulfilling part of making figures?!

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9, out.width = "80%"}
planetary_dat <- planetary_dat %>% 
  mutate(planet_pad = ifelse(nchar(planet)%%2 == 0, 
                             str_pad(planet, width = 50, side = "both"),
                             str_pad(planet, width = 51, side = "both")))  # pad the labels

P_solar_system <- P_solar_system + 
  geom_text(data = planetary_dat, aes(x = row_id, y = 0, color = row_id,
                                          label = glue("{planet_pad}")),
            size = 2.5, fontface = "bold", hjust = 0.7) + 
  geom_richtext(data = planetary_dat, aes(x = 3.3, y = 18.2,
                                          label = "<b><span style = 'font-size:25pt'>A</span>n<span> </span><span style = 'font-size:25pt'>E</span>pic<span> </span><span style = 'font-size:25pt'>J</span>ourney<span> </span>to<span> </span>the<span> </span><span style = 'font-size:25pt'>G</span>lowing<span> </span><span style = 'font-size:25pt'>S</span>olar<span> </span><span style = 'font-size:25pt'>S</span>ystem</b><br>"),
                size = 5, 
                color = NA,
                fill = NA,
                text.color = "#09bab7",
                family = "Bookman",
                fontface = "bold.italic")

P_solar_system

```

### Leg 7. Sprinkle some glittering stars

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 9, out.width = "80%"}
set.seed(123)
stars_df <- data.frame(x = runif(50),
                       y = runif(50),
                       size = runif(50))

P_stars <- ggplot() + 
  geom_point_blur(data = stars_df, aes(x = x, y = y, size = size,
                                       blur_size = size), 
                  color = "white", alpha = 0.5, show.legend = F) + 
  scale_blur_size_continuous(range = c(0, 2)) +
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(0, 0.35)) + 
  theme_void() + 
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = "transparent", 
                                       color = "transparent"))

library(cowplot)

P_final <- ggdraw(P_solar_system) + 
  draw_plot(P_stars)

P_final

```

We're at the very end of the solar system. It's time to go back to the Earth. See you next time!
