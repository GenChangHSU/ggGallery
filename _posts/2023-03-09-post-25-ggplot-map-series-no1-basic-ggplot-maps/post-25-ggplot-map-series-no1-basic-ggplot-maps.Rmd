## Background

Welcome to my second blog post series: the ggplot Map Series! Maps are a staple for research, science communication, and even everyday life. In this series, I'll write about making all kinds of maps in ggplots: polygon maps, vector maps, and raster maps, using a variety of data sources from built-in package data sets and online databases, to manually-created data and other external files. Making maps is a critical skill to have under the belt and will certainly go a long way, and I hope this series will come in handy for every reader, you included of course!

## Introduction

There are a diverse set of maps in ggplots. In this first post of the series, I'll just start simple with the most basic type of mapsâ€”the polygon maps, using the built-in map data from the `maps` and `mapdata` package.

## Create a polygon map with `maps`

In the following section, we'll first create a basic world map using the world map data in `maps` package. Next, we'll turn this basic map into a choropleth map by adding a theme to it. Finally, we'll take a look at some other available map data in the `maps` package as well as the supplementary `mapdata` package.

### 1. A basic world map

basic world map
projection
background theme

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "70%", fig.show = "hold"}
library(tidyverse)
library(maps)



```




### 2. Choropleth map

Add top ten peaks in the world
Add number of bird species by country

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "70%", fig.show = "hold"}



```






### 3. Other available map data

```{r, fig.width = 6, fig.height = 4, out.width = "70%", fig.show = "hold"}
library(mapdata)


```
